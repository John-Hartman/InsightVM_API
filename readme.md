This branch holds scripts for copying data from one IVM console to another

These scripts are as-is

The IVM-Functions and copy_sites scripts are meant to be used together and all other scripts are currently stand alone scripts built to only do their specific purpose. Some of those other scripts functions are essentially built into the copy_sites script.
