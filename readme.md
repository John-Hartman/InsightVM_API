This repository holds some helpful scripts for working with the Rapid7 InsightVM API.

Some scripts are created for copying data from one console to another, setting the scan template on all sites, or changing the schedule for all scheduled scans.

The functions doc is just for interacting with the InsightVM API to cut the clutter out of the main code
